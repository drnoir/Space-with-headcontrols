# Space with headcontrols ver 1.0
## An expereiment in using JeelizFAceFilter
By DrNoir [Chris Godber](www.chrisgodber.co.uk)

This is an implemention of the headcontrols demo from the JeelizFaceFilter headcontrols demo
I wanted to create a space scene and learn more about how to use facetracking for navigating three js scenes so I created a space scene which you can control with your webcam.
This is a very nice library looking foward to expereimenting with it more!

Based on the [headcontrols](https://github.com/jeeliz/jeelizFaceFilter/tree/master/demos/threejs/headControls) demo

###To install - 
Simply clone / unzip contents and open the index html file.
I hope someone can find it useful, mod it for a game etc.
I plan on making the space scene more realistic and working on it when I have time
